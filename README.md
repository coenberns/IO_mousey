# IO_mousey
A jupyter notebook complemented with text to make it easy for the next user to perform the analyses that I performed. 
If you want any help, you can contact me. Ask for my email if talking to Mario or Lennart. In any case, it should not be so hard to understand what is happening in the different blocks of code. Please, make sure that your DIR is similar and you are logged into the GlobalConnect VPN of CUBE or at the lab. 

Good luck and have fun,
Coen


NB. for the baseline voltages, there have been some adaptations and you may have to look into the files in M van Engelen to find and then load them to make sure that everything runs smoothly. For the moment, I cannot do this as I cannot get on the server (phone has been stolen and, therefore, I do not have the possibility to fill in an OTP). Therefore, the last two plots cannot be directly observed in the notebook in this repository. Another way, is to include them by rerunning simulations without spikes to obtain the baseline voltages.
