A jupyter notebook complemented with text to make it easy for the next user to perform the analyses that I performed. 
If you want any help, you can contact me. Ask for my email if talking to Mario or Lennart. In any case, it should not be so hard to understand what is happening in the different blocks of code. Please, make sure that your DIR is similar and you are logged into the GlobalConnect VPN of CUBE or at the lab. 

Good luck and have fun,
Coen
